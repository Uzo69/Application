Tell us about you, your values, and why you want to coordinate RoboSats.
Share something about yourself.

Keep calm and keep buying

Development Funding
Donations to the Development Fund (DevFund) are voluntary with no minimum amount. The default donation rate in the Coordinator backend is 20%. The value entered here is for display purposes and can be updated later via a PR. Ideally, it should match the donation rate set in your .env file. The RoboSats client app randomly sorts coordinators weighted by their DevFund donation value. Thus, the orders of the coordinators that contribute to the development have a higher chance to appear first in the Order book. Coordinators who contribute to the DevFund are more likely to receive support if needed (note that unless the devs are under time constraints support is unlikely to be denied). These patron perks are the way developers say "thank you for your contribution!". The RoboSats development team has an exciting roadmap ahead. However, once RoboSats is decentralized, the only source of funding for further development and maintaining the codebase will be donations (we do not accept venture-capital investments).

Your permanent identity. If needed, you may have to verify your identity to robots or other coordinators by signing a message.

Coordinator Policies
The following three sections are designed to inform robots about your service expectations as a coordinator. It's perfectly acceptable to refine your policies over time, as coordinating RoboSats is a learning process. However, remember that robots appreciate clear and concise terms.

Privacy Policy
*
e.g., 1) TLSnotary might be required for evidence submission in disputes. 2) Full user identification may be necessary to verify ownership of the payment method.
Describe how you will handle privacy. For example, what kind of evidence will be required in a dispute? How will sensitive information be treated?

Data Policy
*
e.g., Data will not be shared or sold to any third party. The database will be cleared every 7 days, except for orders under dispute...
Explain your data handling practices. For instance, what is your data retention policy? Will data be shared with third parties? Although a RoboSats coordinator's data collection is limited by design, a coordinator could still learn about users through heuristic analysis, payout node pubkeys, onchain addresses, dispute statements, evidence submission, etc.

Other Policies
*
e.g.
"Rule #1": "You do not talk about RoboSats Club"
"Rule #2": "You DO NOT talk about RoboSats Club"
Any other policies can be set here.

Coordinator Addresses
Your coordinator API should be publicly accessible via an Onion hidden service. Optionally, you can also expose your API over I2P for redundancy, ensuring robots can still use your service if TOR is under attack. Clearnet endpoints can also be added to your coordinator. You can create new tor2web aliases on services like clearnetonion.eu.org or others (do your own research).

Onion Mainnet Coordinator Service Address
*
e.g. http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion
The Onion hidden service where your MAINNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found.

Onion Testnet Coordinator Service Address
*
e.g. http://robotestagw3dcxmd66r4rgksb4nmmr43fh77bzn2ia2eucduyeafnyd.onion
The Onion hidden service where your TESTNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found.

I2P Mainnet Coordinator Service Address
e.g. http:///.........b32.i2p
The I2P service where your MAINNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found (Optional).

I2P Testnet Coordinator Service Address
e.g. hhttp:///.........b32.i2p
The I2P service where your TESTNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found (Optional).

Clearnet Mainnet Coordinator Service Address
e.g. http://mainnet.coordinator.com
The Clearnet address where your MAINNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found.

Clearnet Testnet Coordinator Service Address
e.g. http://testnet.coordinator.com
The Clearnet address where your TESTNET RoboSats coordinator API can be found.

Node Pubkeys
Enter your Lightning node pubkeys (also known as node_id). You can enter multiple pubkeys (comma-separated) for both mainnet and testnet. If you haven't created the lightning node yet, enter a placeholder. These pubkeys will be used to direct robots to explorers to find your node (e.g., 1ML or Amboss).
